                The punishment to face after I stop breathing, passing burdens onto people leaving them in pain
                seething, the gifted oath restricting hands from causing harm... if you try then I must die as if broken
                again
                I won't get that back, if stays there one more pulse in my body then kill me again physically for I
                cannot
                face
                that detest towards my being. I sometimes deem that worse than my grave's black...
            </p>
            <p class="lil-margin font-2">
                Can't say lives will be better without me... I know a selfish step would ruin them more. Don't look for
                me for I am always hiding. Afraid of pain
                that comes with the cold steel blade cutting through the skin yet after every
                misery that's the first thing I start thinking.
            </p>
            <p class="lil-margin red font-7 bold-lett">
                What's the point of the failed attempts?
            </p>
            <p class="lil-margin font-7 small-sizing">
                To only be left with a wasted promise, wasted time, damn wasted resources... A drama caused
                and left more regretful than before facing the bitter aversion in someone's eyes.
            </p>
            <p class="lil-margin font-2">
                What's a reason to live? What's mine? If not just some strings of mere fears keeping me from becoming a
                limp flesh.
