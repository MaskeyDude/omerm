            <p class="lil-margin font-2">Little notes being teared... laying in the trash. Random messages about the day
                now a
                spam... what a
                disturbance! How precious are your messages now what they are other than a deleted chat? Surrounded by
                people and I feel your attention only on me... what a twist is it now I am unseen as if I
                am not here
                and only the ones who exist are the people surrounding me.
            </p>

            <p class="lil-margin font-2">
                The little treats causing the eyes to smile;
                Returned with bluntness today as if you don't care. I won't drink water if it's you who is the one to
                offer. Maybe the love died finally... but where's the care for me?
            </p>

            <p class="lil-margin font-1 lil-sizing">
                "Maybe you care." "No I don't."
            </p>

            <p class="lil-margin font-2">
                Then why the hatred? Why the negative harshness?
            </p>

            <p class="font-1 lil-sizing">Maybe the price of loving someone it seems but maybe look
                more carefully as it seems more like a price of disrespect to me.
